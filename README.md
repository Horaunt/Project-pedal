#Project PedalPals

Hello everyone! We are presenting a idea of creating a website for renting cycles for short hours.
Being in a college we have very hectic days and hectic timetable running from one block to another and again to another block. What if we can rent a cycle for few hours?
By creating this website we are placing a platform where all the vitians can connect and people who are in need can rent by seeing the availability in the nearest cycle stand through the website.  This will encourage convenient transportation for many students, also footpaths will be less crowded and people can travel longer distance in short interval. Also you can also go to the places where shuttle won’t go or won’t stop. Also if you want to travel to different spots in vit frequently you don’t have to take shuttle you can take cycle which will save your money too!
And if you have the cycle then you can rent it to the people and you will be awarded service charges from which you can grab your snack.

So, in this website you will login through your vit email id and profile will be made. You will be having three options: to rent a cycle, to give your cycle for rent or to sell your cycle.

The owner of the cycle who wants to give cycle for renting will place its cycle availability for how many hours, cycle stand where it is kept, and identification of the cycle. For example: green and black colour, with gears having yellow mudguard of Avon company.
When you will choose to rent a cycle option you will finding a list of all cycle stands in VIT. Choose the nearest cycle stand for you. The availability will be shown with the no of hours. Choose according to your convenience by seeing the cycle and contacting to the owner whose phone no will be placed in his/her profile.
